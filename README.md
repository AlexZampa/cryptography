# Cryptography

This repository collects the source code of the exercises of the Cryptography course of the CyberSecurity career of Computer Engineering of the Politecnico di Torino.

- The `open-ssl/` folder contains the usage of the OpenSSL library to perform cryptographic operations, for C progtramming language.

- The `common-attacks/` folder contains python scripts to perform some basic attacks to different cryptographic algorithm.

## Usage

The `openssl` library used for the C programming language, works only on a Linux environment.

The majority of python scripts use `pycryptodome` and `pwntools` libraries, which I found to be slower on Windows, so also here Linux is recommended.
